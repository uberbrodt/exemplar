#Propertizer: Generate mutators and accessors for Go struct types.

Basically a rip off of [Stringer](https://godoc.org/github.com/Go-zh/tools/cmd/stringer), but generates you Getters and Setters for structs.

###Hold on, why do I need this? This isn't Java?!
Good point! But like Java, Go is statically typed. If you want to write tests, you'll probably need interfaces. You can't specify fields as part of an interface, so that means you'll need methods.

###How to use

`go get install github.com/uberbrodt/propertizer`

Pick a type and point it towards the relevant filed

`propertizer -type YourStruct /github.com/your/package/yourstruct.go`

And it'll generate you a file called `yourstruct_propertizer.go`


####examples

Here's an example struct:

	//go:generate propertizer -type Basicstruct
	type Basicstruct struct {
		id           int
		date         time.Time
		status       string
		hiddenField  string
		privateField string `propertizer:"private"`
	}

running `go generate` inside of the package that contains this struct will automatically generate `basicstruct_properties.go` which will look like this:

	// Code generated by "propertizer-type=Basicstruct testdata/basicstruct.go"; DO NOT EDIT

	package main

	import "time"

	func (this *Basicstruct) ID() int {
		return this.id
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) SetID(x int) {
		this.id = x
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) Date() time.Time {
		return this.date
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) SetDate(x time.Time) {
		this.date = x
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) Status() string {
		return this.status
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) SetStatus(x string) {
		this.status = x
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) HiddenField() string {
		return this.hiddenField
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) SetHiddenField(x string) {
		this.hiddenField = x
	}


####Private fields

You can mark a field as private (ie. Don't generate getters or setters) with the `propertizer:"private"` struct tag.

####Getter Prefix
Adding the flag `--getterPrefix` will preface the accessors with "Get". This is necessary where you have a struct that is also being used for JSON marshaling, and you need your field names to remain public. Go will throw an error when a method has the same name as a field ie. obj.ID() and obj.ID

##TODO
* Handle _ and aliased imports
* Auto generate tests for structs? We already compile the package after running, so really only useful if you're worried about code coverage metrics
