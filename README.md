#Exemplar: A Go Code Generator

Exempler is a code generator for Go based off of [Stringer](https://godoc.org/github.com/Go-zh/tools/cmd/stringer). It parses the target package, generates code based off provided struct(s) and then verfies that the package still works. It even runs `gofmt` afterwards so that your generated code is pretty!

Originally, this project was called Propertizer, and generated accessors and mutators for structs, but I realized that what I really needed was a way to generate DAO and RESTful resource-like code, becuase it's tedious to create and update. So I added in the nice [Cobrat](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) CLI tool and made Propertizer a sub command. The plan is to add two more commands:

* `model` will generate DAO like code for a struct using [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx). Support will expand eventually to support raw database/sql and other datastores as needed.
*  `resource` will generate a set of REST methods and muxer routes (GET /foo/:id, PUT /foo/:id, etc) for a struct. The aim will be to make it solely standard library, but might support either [negroni](https://github.com/codegangsta/negroni) or [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) out of the box

##Commands

###Propertizer: Generate mutators and accessors for Go struct types.

Generates you Getters and Setters for structs. Can ignore fields and generate interfaces for the getters and setters as well

###Hold on, why do I need this? This isn't Java?!
Well, you generally don't. For some reason I thought I needed this, but upon further review I didn't :(

Oh well, at least I learned a lot and now I'll put that knowledge to use to create something useful.

###How to use

`go get install github.com/uberbrodt/exemplar`

Pick a type and point it towards the relevant file

`exemplar propertizer -type YourStruct /github.com/your/package/yourstruct.go`

And it'll generate you a file called `yourstruct_propertizer.go`


####examples

Here's an example struct:

	//go:generate propertizer -type Basicstruct
	type Basicstruct struct {
		id           int
		date         time.Time
		status       string
		hiddenField  string
		privateField string `propertizer:"private"`
	}

running `go generate` inside of the package that contains this struct will automatically generate `basicstruct_properties.go` which will look like this:

	// Code generated by "propertizer-type=Basicstruct testdata/basicstruct.go"; DO NOT EDIT

	package main

	import "time"

	func (this *Basicstruct) ID() int {
		return this.id
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) SetID(x int) {
		this.id = x
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) Date() time.Time {
		return this.date
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) SetDate(x time.Time) {
		this.date = x
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) Status() string {
		return this.status
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) SetStatus(x string) {
		this.status = x
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) HiddenField() string {
		return this.hiddenField
	}
	func (this *Basicstruct) SetHiddenField(x string) {
		this.hiddenField = x
	}


####Private fields

You can mark a field as private (ie. Don't generate getters or setters) with the `propertizer:"private"` struct tag.

####Getter Prefix
Adding the flag `--getterPrefix` will preface the accessors with "Get". This is necessary where you have a struct that is also being used for JSON marshaling, and you need your field names to remain public. Go will throw an error when a method has the same name as a field ie. obj.ID() and obj.ID

####TODO
* Handle _ and aliased imports
* Auto generate tests for structs? We already compile the package after running, so really only useful if you're worried about code coverage metrics
